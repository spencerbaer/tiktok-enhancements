  <h2>Mark Liked Videos</h2>

  <p>
    If you want to see which videos you have liked when browsing by user or by sound, upload a list of your liked videos and the thumbnails of your liked videos will be shown at 
    a reduced opacity to make them stand out.

    You can supply a URL from which to fetch a list of video URLs or a list of ids, or you can upload a file. 
    
    To generate a list of liked videos, navigate to your liked videos, use the "Auto Scroll" button to scroll to the bottom, 
    and then use the "Download URLs" button to download a list of URLs. Upload them below.
  </p>
  
  <p>There are currently <span id="favorites-count">?</span> liked videos that have been uploaded.</p>

  <button id="clear-liked">Clear Liked Videos</button>
  <button id="refresh-favorites">Refresh Favorites</button>

  <h3>Option 1: Fetch From Server</h3>

  <p>Provide a fully-qualified URL, and we will issue a GET request. The expected response is a json array of URLs or ids.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Option 2: Upload a file</h3>

  <p>Upload a plain text file of video URLs or ids. Line-separated.</p>
